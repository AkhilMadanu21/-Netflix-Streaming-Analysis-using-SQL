![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a7b3e91-232f-4dbf-a26e-29093ebd1ae0)
A portfolio project that explores user behavior, subscription trends, movie ratings, and content consumption patterns using SQL queries on a simulated Netflix-style dataset. Covers key business questions like top watched movies, genre popularity, most active users, and average ratings by plan.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing data from a Netflix-style streaming platform using SQL. Through 19 insightful queries, it uncovers key business and user engagement metrics such as subscription trends, most-watched content, user behavior, ratings distribution, and platform usage. The goal is to demonstrate practical SQL skills and the ability to derive meaningful insights from relational databases.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview
The dataset is a simulated Netflix-style database composed of the following relational tables:

- users â€“ User ID, name, country, and demographic data
- subscriptions â€“ Subscription details including plan type, start and end dates
- movies â€“ Movie metadata including title, genre, and duration
- watch_history â€“ Movie watch records linked to users and dates
- ratings â€“ User-provided movie ratings
- devices â€“ Device and operating system information per user
- The dataset reflects real-world streaming service scenarios with relationships between users, content, and activity.

## Project structure 
- **Database Setup**: Creation of the `Netflix` database.
- **Importing data**: Importing sample csv file into tables.
- **Business Problems**: Solving 19 specific business problems using SQL queries.

## Database Setup
```sql
CREATE DATABASE `Netflix`;
```
## Data Import
